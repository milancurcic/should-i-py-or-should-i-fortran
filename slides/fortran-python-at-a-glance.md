### Fortran at a glance

* A _compiled_, _statically typed_, _parallel_ programming language
* Created by John Backus and his team at IBM in 1957
* Designed for scientific and engineering applications
* The oldest high-level programming language still in use
* Standardized since 1966
* In active development: Fortran 2018 released in November 2018, Fortran 202x is in the works

### Python at a glance

* An _interpreted_, _dynamically typed_ programming language
* Created by Guido van Rossum in 1993
* General purpose: Data analysis, web development, GUIs, real-time systems etc.
* Currently the [fastest growing programming language](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/14/python-growing-quickly)
* In active development: Python 3.7.3 released in March 2019

### Key differences

* Compiled vs. interpreted
* Static, manifest vs. dynamic, inferred typing
* Focus on numerics and parallelism vs. rich standard library and ecosystem
