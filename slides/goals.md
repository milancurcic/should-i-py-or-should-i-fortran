### What this talk is about

* An overview of Fortran and Python from the perspective of
language design, features, and usefulness
* Not a tutorial (but you'll still learn something)
* Will voice strong opinions
* It's OK if we disagree -- I'd love to learn from you!

### Target audience

1. Early career scientists and engineers
2. Have at least some programming experience
3. Works or will work on a software project

### Approach

Language history and design -> governs **what you can do** with it
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Type system -> governs **how you will work** with it
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Features, standard library, and the ecosystem -> governs **how useful it is** for different tasks
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
</section>

### Questions I'll try to answer

* When to use Fortran or Python (or both) in your software project?
* When do they work well together?
