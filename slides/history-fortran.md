### A brief history of Fortran

To really understand a person, we need to know where they're coming from <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Ditto for programming languages <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### The IBM FORTRAN Era

* FORTRAN (1957): Created by John Backus and his team at IBM
* FORTRAN II (1958): Procedural programming
* FORTRAN III (1958): Minor stuff, never released
* FORTRAN IV (1958): `LOGICAL` data type! Logical `IF` statements!

### The FORTRAN Standards Era

* FORTRAN 66 (1966): The first FORTRAN Standard (ANSI)
  - Intrinsic data types
  - Comments in source code
* FORTRAN 77 (1978): Major update to the Standard (ISO)
  - Improved `DO` and `IF` blocks
  - `CHARACTER` data type
  - `PARAMETER` for declaring constants
</section>

<section>

### The Modern Fortran Era

* Fortran 90: Free-form, derived types, allocatable arrays, whole-array operations
* Fortran 95: Minor stuff, mostly for vector supercomputers of the time
* Fortran 2003: Object-oriented programming, standardized C-interop
</section>

<section>

### The Modern Fortran Era, continued

* Fortran 2008: Native parallelism with coarrays, submodules
* Fortran 2018: Teams, events, improved C-interop
* Fortran 202x: TBD :)
</section>

### Fortran moves slowly but surely

* Standard Committee ensures that **stays great** for scientists and engineers
* Revisions to the Standard every 5-10 years
* Tedious and bureaucratic process
* Slowly deprecate ancient features
* Resist language bloat (ahem, C++ ðŸ™„)
</section>

### So, what've we got today?

A small language that does a few things great <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Basically backwards compatible <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Several excellent compilers <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

A treasure vault of battle-tested numerical libraries <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
