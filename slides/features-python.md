### Let's talk about Python

* Easy to get started with
* Comprehensive standard library: collections, algorithms, I/O ...
* Amazing library ecosystem
* Standard package management

### Comprehensive standard library

Python was designed to be a small language with a large standard library

<section>

### Amazing library ecosystem

Numeric and scientific computing: numpy, scipy, sympy, xarray...

Visualization: matplotlib, plotly, bokeh...

Tables and time series: pandas

Machine Learning: scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras, pytorch
</section>

### Standard package management

Extremely easy to set up development environment and install packages:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -U matplotlib numpy pandas
```
</section>

### Python is a good solution for most problems

Systems programming, real-time systems, networking

Web development, Databases, Video games

Numerical analysis, machine learning

**=> I can't think of another language that does almost everything reasonably well**
